  <h2>Process of creating a Web Page</h2>
  <h3>October 10<sup>th</sup>, 2016</h3>
  <p>I didn’t have any trouble creating the html file for the Roaster page.
    I made sure to get the indentation right and the code looks much better and
    well organized with the indentation in place. However, I made an error with
    the syntax of the anchor tag wherein I interchanged the ‘=’ and the ‘href’.
    I realized the error when testing the html page to check if it was correctly
    linking to the other page and it obviously, wasn’t. Other than that, there
    were no glitches in getting the html code up and running.</p>
  <p>Another issue I had was with linking the css file to the html version. I
    started with creating a new css file named ‘our-roasters.css’ and tried
    linking it to ‘our-roasters.html’ only to find, much to my disappointment
    that it wasn’t working. I was struggling for about fifteen minutes to see
    if I had made any mistake with naming conventions or the code. And, later
    realized that I am supposed to use one master css file for all html pages.
    Therefore I ended up linking ‘coffee-shop.css’ to ‘our-roasters.html’.</p>
   <p>The one question I have in mind is about linking multiple html files with
     the same css file. What can I do if every page is unique and if the one css
     file can’t cater to the needs of different files. Is there any way to use
     multiple css files?</p>
