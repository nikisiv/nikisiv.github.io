    <h1>How much water do you Eat? - An Installation </h1>
    <img src="images/front_view_water.jpg" />
    <p>The installation was aimed at creating an awareness about conserving water
    by making wise food choices about the kinds of food we eat.</p>
    <img src="images/perspective_view_water.jpg" />
    <p>The concept of virtual water i.e.,
the amount of water that goes into
the processing of various food items,
was introduced to people through
the installation. Five predominant
food items were chosenn namely:
beef, chicken, cheese, pork and
greens.

Depending on the amount of water
that went into the processing of
each of these food items, water
columns were constructed using
test tubes. Each water column
had varying levels of water dependin
on the food item.

For instance, beef had the tallest
water column as it consumed 4000
gallons of water per pound for
processing while greens had the
shortest water column with
400 gallons of water per pound
for processing.

Also, the water columns were
color coded. Red refers to a huge
consumption of water for processing
while yellow and green refer to
medium and low levels of water
consumption respectively.</p>

<p>Our team consisted of five designers. My specific role in the project was
to design the animation
that was projected on the
LED screen.

  <h2>Installation at The Impact HUB, Oakland</h2>
<img src="images/ih1.jpg" />
<p>This installation is an adaptation of the test-tube water installation. This installation was set up at
The Watersong summit event organized at the Impact HUB, Oakland by DIG Cooperative. We
decided to construct towers for each food item that vary in length according to the water that
went into the production of the food item. We suspended these towers from the ceiling and installed
LED lamps inside of each tower.</p>
<img src="images/ih2.jpg" />
<p>My role involved the making of the eames cards towers. The making consisted of designing the
template for the cards on Illustrator, laser cutting and arranging the cards in the form of towers.</p>
<img src="images/ih3.jpg" />
<p>The template for the cards were
designed on Illustrator.

The cards were laser cut.The cards were stacked and experiments
were carried out with different positions
of LED lamp inside the eames card tower
to observe the shadow patterns.

The towers were decided to be suspended
from the ceiling.</p>
